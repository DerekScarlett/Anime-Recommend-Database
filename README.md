How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB,CRUD

I built the server using node and express modules. I made a collection on mlad so that I could have a place to store my data I also used click events to add info to the database and append to the DOM my recommendations.

Optimizations
If I have time to come back to this I would allow people to click on the shows they want and add comments to them. I also what to be able to list out how many seasons each show has.

Lessons Learned:
I learn how to use express, mongodb and crud to build, host, and run my apps.
